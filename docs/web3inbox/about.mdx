# Introduction

:::caution
Web3Inbox is in alpha development
:::

The Web3Inbox SDK provides a toolkit for integrating web3 communications messaging features into dapps. It utilizes WalletConnect's Notify and Chat APIs to support app notifications and wallet-to-wallet messaging, enhancing user interaction and feature availability.

The Web3Inbox SDK offers tools to incorporate web3 messaging capabilities into dapps. It leverages WalletConnect's Notify and Chat APIs for dapp notifications and direct messaging between wallets.

Notify is designed for web3 scenarios, providing event-based notifications for activities like DAO votes, DeFi transaction alerts, and updates for NFT holders.

Chat facilitates direct messaging between wallets, support chats for dapps, and interactions with automated bots.
